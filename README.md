## Overview

The InfluxDB Connector connects to an InfluxDB database, takes a backup of the specified database and uploads the backup files on Storj network.

```bash
Usage:
  connector-influxdb [command] <flags>

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  store       Command to upload data to a Storj V3 network.
  version     Prints the version of the tool

```



`store` - Connect to the specified database (default: `db_property.json`).  Backups of the database are generated using tooling provided by InfluxDB then uploaded to the Storj network.  Connect to a Storj v3 network using the access specified in the Storj configuration file (default: `storj_config.json`). 



Sample configuration files are provided in the `./config` folder.
